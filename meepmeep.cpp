 *      To help test whether your puzzle submissions fit the guidelines, try 
 *      this simple test puzzle. Your solution must follow the guidelines like 
 *      any other puzzle. Write a program that takes as input a single argument 
 *      on the command line. Normally this argument must be the name of a text 
 *      file; however, for this puzzle your program should ignore the argument 
 *      given. Instead, your program must print to standard out the string 
 *      "Meep meep!" (without the double quotes and with exact capitalization) 
 *      followed by a single newline (not zero or two).
